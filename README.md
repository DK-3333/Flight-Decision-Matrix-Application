# Flight-Decision-Matrix-Application
This project explores AI-driven decision support for flight scheduling and compliance management. It includes a prototype system that aids pilot decision-making, ensures regulatory compliance (e.g., CBA rules), and improves operational efficiency tailored to anonymized client needs.

Welcome aboard with our **Pilot Buddy** an AI-powered assistant built for pilots to simplify contract navigation, fatigue tracking, and schedule clarity.
Think of it as your smart first officer, always on duty, never off course.
